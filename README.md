 1.Lead a team of 5 people to manage, operate, and support Arc Gis Pro platform. 

 2.Experienced in using UAVs to collect high-resolution aerial imagery for urban change detection.

 3.Familiar with a variety of remote sensing data processing techniques, including image registration, feature extraction, and change detection algorithms.

 4.Conducted literature reviews and produced original content based on current research 

 5.Developing a UAV-based change detection system for monitoring urban growth in a developing country.

 6.Using UAV imagery to track the impact of a natural disaster on an urban area.

 7.Automating the process of urban change detection using machine learning techniques.

CONCLUSION:It is observed from the change detection study around periphery of urban area near Nagpur city is dynamic to the changes due
to urbanization of the metro city areas. The percentage change in vegetation classes in the year 2022 has been change from
11% to 22%, the change in wasteland in 2022 is 46% over 82% in 2002 and the major change occurred due to urbanization in
Nagpur city area shows the changes from 7% in 2002 to 32% in 2022.
